<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread 
    and it's wonderful ! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled 
    and they're perfect!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
        <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. 
            Place pit side down onto the grill. 
        <li>Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. 
            Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. 
            Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. 
        <li>Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm.</li> 
        <li>Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
